# Inabris - A personal worldbuilding and creative writing project by [Aethari](https://github.com/Aethari)
Welcome to the Inabris project, a place for me to build a complicated world and store my creative
writings. This repo contains the development of this world, and will be updated with new writings
frequently as I make more content. I made this project to bolster my writing skills, as well as
to have a creative outlet when I get bored of game development.  

This project was designed so that other artists, if inspired, can use the world and stories from
it in their own works. **If you want to use Inabris, for your project, please review the [license](#License)
for usage rights.**

## Navigation
As the project and the world grow, it will become increasingly harder to find specifics, and
just as hard for new readers to find a starting point. This is where you can come, almost like
a table of contents, to find your way around the world of Inabris.

### Starting point
If you are new to Inabris, it is recommended you start with the [world creation lore](World/
Inabris.md), which details how Inabris came to be and provides a groundwork for the rest of the
characters and stories. From there, you can step through the timeline, exploring the world as
you go.

### Structure
Inabris is split into distinct time periods, which can span thousands or even hundreds of
thousands of years. Each time period is rife with stories and adventures, and has a multitude
of characters. Each time period gets a designated folder, plus an `PERIOD.md` file that
explains the period and what the world was like.  

Each period has several subfolders: one for characters, stories, and misc information. It
is recommended that, instead of navigating the project like you would with a normal repo
or file browser, you use the "table of contents" present in each `PERIOD.md` file. Each
story will also have links to relevant characters pertaining to that story, so that you
can easily obtain information about the people in the story you are reading.

### Table of Contents
| **Period Name**                  | **Time span (years)** |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [First Era](First_Era/PERIOD.md) |                       |

## Status
This project doesn't really have a structured deadline for any stories or characters. I pretty
much just work on it when I want to, which will lead to irregular updates and additions to the
world. I don't really expect Inabris to ever be "finished" really - time is endless, and there 
are an infinite amount of stories that can be created in an infinite world.
